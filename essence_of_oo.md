1. What is code rot, and why does it happen?
- Code rot occurs when coders get careless with their code and take shortcuts to make it more convenient. This makes the code messy and spirals out of control. Code rot is when the code is high level processes depend on low level details, not the other way around as it should be. Good code allows the main program not needed to be edited with every small change.
